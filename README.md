This is the Aloha Apparel project (Project 1) for RED Academy Web Development course 2018.

It uses HTML, CSS & CSS Flexbox and jQuery to create a responsive website for a clothing company.
The website is created using mobile-first approach and it's optimized for 3 screen sizes with breakpoints of 600px and 1240px.

The user is able to take a look at different categories, which are marked as links for future use, browse through different products and add them to the cart and sign up for a newsletter, which would also be a future implementation.
